            <p class="tagline">A consumer company building the interface for the world to access AI.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="about">
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Firstline is building the primary way people interact with artificial intelligence. We believe AI should be as easy to use as a search engine was in 2000 or a smartphone was in 2010. The technology exists. The interface doesn't. That's what we're building.</p>
            <p>We're not building another chatbot. We're not building another API wrapper. We're building the consumer interface layer that sits between humans and the entire AI ecosystem — the single point of access for anyone who wants to use AI to get things done.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="vision">
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>AI is the most transformative technology since the internet. But right now, using AI is fragmented, confusing, and inaccessible to most people. There are hundreds of models, thousands of tools, and no unified way to access them.</p>
            <p>We're building the interface that makes AI accessible to the other 8 billion people who don't know what a prompt is, don't care about model architectures, and just want AI to help them live better lives.</p>
            <p>Our goal is simple: become the default way humans interact with AI.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="approach">
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>We're consumer-first. We obsess over user experience, not benchmarks. We care about what people actually need, not what's technically impressive. We build for the mainstream, not for developers.</p>
            <p>We're model-agnostic. We don't care which AI model is best this week. We integrate with all of them and route users to whatever works best for their specific task. The interface stays consistent. The intelligence underneath keeps getting better.</p>
            <p>We're building for the long term. AI interfaces will evolve dramatically over the next decade. We're building the foundation that adapts with the technology, not a product that becomes obsolete when the next model drops.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="principles">
            <h2>Principles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simplicity over features.</strong> Every feature we add must make the product simpler to use, not more complex.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed matters.</strong> AI should feel instant. Every millisecond of latency is a failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy by default.</strong> We don't sell user data. We don't train on user data without consent. We don't compromise on privacy for convenience.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility is non-negotiable.</strong> If someone can't use our product, that's our failure, not theirs.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency always.</strong> Users should always know when they're talking to AI, what data is being used, and how decisions are made.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="team">
            <h2>Team</h2>
            <p>We're a small team based in Jersey City, New Jersey. We're engineers, designers, and product people who've built consumer products used by millions. We're backed by people who believe in what we're building.</p>
            <p>We're hiring. If you want to work on the most important interface problem of the decade, reach out.</p>
